# README Generator

_**Generating READMEs for your code repositories just got easier.**_

The README Generator is a command-line tool designed to facilitate the creation
of README files for your code repositories. The generator uses OpenAI's GPT
model to parse your code and generate a README for it. As it's using glob
patterns, it can work with any code that ChatGPT understands. The most exciting
part? This README itself was generated by the tool. Isn't it cool?

## Feature Set

- Supports glob patterns for wide-ranging code compatibility.
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3/GPT-4 model to understand your code.
- Generates READMEs in markdown format.
- Easy to use with command-line interface.
- Automatically incorporates user prompts for more accurate results.

## Usage

To get started with README Generator, you first need to install the library. You
can do this using the go package manager `go`:

```sh
go get github.com/jtarchie/readme-generator
```

Once installed, you can use the tool from the command line as shown:

```sh
readme-generator --glob=*.go --prompt="Some additional instructions"
```

Here, the `--glob` flag is used to specify the pattern of the files to read to
help determine the README content (in this case, all Go files), and `--prompt`
is used for adding additional prompting. By default, the README is output with
the filename README.md. Use the `--filename` flag followed by the name of your
desired file to change the output filename.

The tool also allows giving the access token for the OpenAI API and choosing the
API model to use, among other options. To get detailed usage instructions, use
the `--help` flag:

```sh
readme-generator --help
```

## TODO

- [ ] Include automatic detection of programming language to adjust the glob
      pattern accordingly.
- [ ] Provide docker support for running the tool.
