# README Generator

The README Generator is a tool that allows you to generate README files for your
code repositories. It aims to provide a starting place for creating informative
and well-structured READMEs. With the ability to specify a glob pattern, the
tool is designed to work with any code that is understandable by ChatGPT, making
it flexible and adaptable.

## Features

- Automated README generation: The tool automates the process of generating
  README files, saving you time and effort.
- Glob pattern support: You can specify a glob pattern to select the files you
  want to include in the README, ensuring that only relevant information is
  included.
- Active voice and removal of duplication: The generated READMEs are written in
  active voice and avoid unnecessary duplication, making them more concise and
  readable.
- Approachable to all software engineers: The READMEs are written in a way that
  is easily understandable by software engineers of all levels of experience.

## Installation

To install the README Generator, follow these steps:
### Homebrew
  
  ```bash
  brew tap jtarchie/readme-generator https://github.com/jtarchie/readme-generator
  brew install readme-generator
  ```

### Go
  1. Ensure you have Go version 1.21.1 or later installed on your system.
  2. Clone the repository:
     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/jtarchie/readme-generator.git
     ```
  3. Change into the project directory:
     ```shell
     cd readme-generator
     ```
  4. Build the project:
     ```shell
     go build -o readme-generator
     ```
  5. Optionally, add the binary to your system's PATH for easier access:
     ```shell
     export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/readme-generator
     ```

## Usage

To use the README Generator, run the following command:

```shell
readme-generator --glob=<glob pattern> --filename=<output filename> --openai-access-token=<OpenAI API token> --base-url=<OpenAI base URL> --prompt=<additional prompt information>
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:

- `<glob pattern>`: The glob pattern specifying the files to read to help
  determine the README content.
- `<output filename>`: The name of the file to output the generated README.
- `<OpenAI API token>`: The API token for the OpenAI API. Make sure to obtain a
  valid token before running the tool.
- `<OpenAI base URL>` (optional): The URL of the OpenAI HTTP domain. If not
  provided, the default value `https://api.openai.com/v1` will be used.
- `<additional prompt information>`: Additional information to provide as a
  prompt when generating the README.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the project, consider the following aspects:

- Ease of use: Assess how easy it is to set up and use the README Generator.
